While Rey was struggeling with here tuition on ahch-to, the resistance was escaping the first order on the planet Crait. 
Poe and Finn discovered an old base from back in the days. The only way to withstand the impactful strike of the first order!

Inside the base you are told to initiate the deflector shields. There is a problem however.
To activate the shields you need to pass the flag. The flag is stored as the admin secret stored in the database.
Unfortunately the admin login has been disabled. Can you find a way around and help to defend against the first order?
Defending the first order might also result in a strong counterstrike maybe preventing the raise of the second order...oh sorry, the last order actually!
You better get the ball rolling!
